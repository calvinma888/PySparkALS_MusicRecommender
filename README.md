<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Many music streaming services, including Spotify or Apple Music, utilize recommendation systems in order to provide users with content that they might enjoy based on their previous listening history. One popular recommender system is called the Alternating Least Squares (ALS), which uses matrix factorization to generate user and song representations, which allows the model to generate personalized recommendations for each user. However, with user data reaching terabytes or even petabytes in size, it no longer suffices to run recommender systems on a single machine due to scalability limitations. Since it requires a cluster of machines to process the data and generate recommendations, PySpark was chosen to accelerate and parallelize the ALS algorithm.
